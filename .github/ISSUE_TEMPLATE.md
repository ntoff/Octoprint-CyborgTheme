## Bug Reports ##

If reporting a bug, please first try with the theme disabled (and ctrl+F5 or "force refresh" your browser) and see if the issue is still present in vanilla OctoPrint.

When reporting issues please include the version of the theme (and branch if you've manually installed one of my weird testing branches) and the version of OctoPrint, that's Octo*Print*, not OctoPi, and the browser you're using. You can find OctoPrint's version in the lower left corner of the UI underneath the files and connections side bar lists, it'll look something like `OctoPrint x.x.x (blah/blah branch)`. 

## Plugin Overrides ##

An additional body class `OctoPrintTheme-Cyborg` has been added for plugin authors who wish to detect this theme's presence and add their own styling conditions to suit, but if you're requesting a colour addition to your plugin, please provide a link to that plugin.
